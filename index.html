        Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This page
        introduces some of the different iteration statements available to
        JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the
        same thing: they repeat an action some number of times (and it's
        actually possible that number could be zero). The various loop
        mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of
        the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by
        one type of loop over the others.

    <section class="main-section" id="for_statement">
      <header>for statement</header>
      <p>
        A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The
        JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        A for statement looks as follows:
        <code>
          for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) <br />
          &nbsp statement
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        When a for loop executes, the following occurs:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-main">
        <li>
          The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed.
          This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the
          syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This
          expression can also declare variables
        </li>
        <li>
          The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is
          true, the loop statements execute. If the value of condition is false,
          the for loop terminates. If the condition expression is omitted
          entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.
        </li>
        <li>
          The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block
          statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
        </li>
        <li>
          If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Control returns to step 2.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="do...while_statement">
      <header>do...while statement</header>
      <p>
        The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates
        to false.
      </p>
      <p>
        A do...while statement looks as follows:
        <code>
          do <br />
          &nbsp statement <br />
          while (condition);
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        statement executes once before the condition is checked. To execute
        multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those
        statements. If condition is true, the statement executes again. At the
        end of every execution, the condition is checked. When the condition is
        false, execution stops and control passes to the statement following
        do...while.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header>while statement</header>
      <p>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
        condition evaluates to true.
      </p>
      <p>
        A while statement looks as follows:
        <code>
          while (condition) <br />
          &nbsp statement
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
        executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
        control is passed to the statement following while.
      </p>
      <p>
        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
        those statements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="labeled_statement">
      <header>labeled statement</header>
      <p>
        A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to
        it elsewhere in your program. For example, you can use a label to
        identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements to
        indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its
        execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The syntax of the labeled statement looks like the following:
        <code>
          label : <br />
          &nbsp statement
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The value of label may be any JavaScript identifier that is not a
        reserved word. The statement that you identify with a label may be any
        statement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="break_statement">
      <header>break statement</header>
      <p>
        Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction
        with a labeled statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use break without a label, it terminates the innermost
        enclosing while, do-while, for, or switch immediately and transfers
        control to the following statement. When you use break with a label, it
        terminates the specified labeled statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The syntax of the break statement looks like this:
        <code>
          break [label];
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The first form of the syntax terminates the innermost enclosing loop or
        switch; the second form of the syntax terminates the specified enclosing
        labeled statement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="continue_statement">
      <header>continue statement</header>
      <p>
        The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or
        label statement.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-main">
        <li>
          When you use continue without a label, it terminates the current
          iteration of the innermost enclosing while, do-while, or for statement
          and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration. In
          contrast to the break statement, continue does not terminate the
          execution of the loop entirely. In a while loop, it jumps back to the
          condition. In a for loop, it jumps to the increment-expression.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you use continue with a label, it applies to the looping
          statement identified with that label.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The syntax of the continue statement looks like the following:
        <code>
          continue [label];
        </code>
      </p>
